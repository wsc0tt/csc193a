        <h1>Visit Santa Cruz County, California</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Santa Cruz</strong> is one of my favorite places to spend the
            weekend in the state of California. Santa Cruz is located on the coast of the
            Pacific Ocean, nestled in between the Santa Cruz Mountains and
            Monterey Bay, making it the perfect weekend escape from the average
            city life. This area of the California coast is known for it's
            moderate climate, wildlife, beautiful beaches and wharfs, and surf
            culture. This coastal gem also features many great local restaurants
            and shops, as well as a vibrant arts and music scene, among many
            other
            <a href="https://www.santacruz.org/things-to-do/">activities</a>. It
            is a great place to explore the natural beauty of California while
            also participating in the laid back beach culture that Santa Cruz is
            known for.
